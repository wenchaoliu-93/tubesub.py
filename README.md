This program fetches the subtitle of a given YouTube video, using an unofficial YouTube API. The YouTube video itself doesn't need to contain all the desired subtitles for this to work.
For instance, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqBqdNIPrbo) has only the English subtitle, but the program was able to generate subtitles of other languages.
